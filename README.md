# paycalc
Simple C language payroll calculator program

I broke this a couple years ago and have now gone back to try and fix it. Current issues are:

-File input mode says it cannot open "filename", then segfaults(11), then crashes
-After completing manual input mode and returning to menu, further menu input causes program to exit
-Several compiler warnings about incompatible pointer types
